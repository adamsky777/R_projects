Appendix A. 
An explanation of the original data-format
The format of **tumor_imaging.dat** is as follows:

Firstly we are given a list of the maximum uptakes for all mice (there are 39 in total) at the first time interval.
Secondly, we are given a list of the mean uptakes for all mice at the first time interval.
Thirdly, we are given a list of the median uptakes for all mice at the first time interval.
This is all information for the first time interval. The system then continues, but for time interval 2.
Fourthly, we are given a list of the maximum uptakes for all mice at the second time interval.
This continues cyclically until the three variables are covered in all 265 time- periods.
Consider the following screen-shot:
